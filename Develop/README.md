# README.md Generator

  ## Description

 My motivation behind this project was to create an easier and more consistant experience for myself when creating a README.md file for my projects. I created it so I could save time and spend that time on the projects themselves. From this project, I leared how to use node as well as the inquirer package within node to create command line tools.

## Installation

To install this project. Install Node.js onto your personal computer and  from there install the inquirer package through the command line. Next create a directory on your computer with the code from my github repository. From there you should be able to run the command 'node index.js' in your command line in the correct directory and my application should work.

## Usage 

This app is specifially for those who would prefer to automate the creating of a README.md file when they are creating a programming project.
